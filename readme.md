# 🏥 **AI-Powered Healthcare Platform**

## 📋 **Introduction**

This project is an AI-powered healthcare platform designed to automate patient interactions, manage appointments, and provide relevant healthcare information. The system leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver a robust and efficient service, integrating real-time and traditional web protocols for a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ **Architecture**

The architecture is built on a **microservices** approach, ensuring scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance. Key components include:

### 🔹 **Frontend**

- **Technology**: `Swift` using `UIKit`
- **Purpose**: A modern and responsive UI for patients and healthcare providers.

### 🔹 **Backend**

- **Technology**: `.NET Core`, `Golang`, `Python`
- **Purpose**: High-performance backend for data processing and interaction management.

### 🔹 **Database**

- **Technology**: `Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)`
- **Purpose**: Reliable, high-performance data management.

### 🔹 **Communication Protocols**

- **WebRTC**: Real-time audio/video calls.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: RESTful API interactions.

## 🧑‍💻 **Technological Stack**

### 📱 **iOS Mobile App**

- **Framework**: `UIKit`
- **Why?** A modern and intuitive framework with tools for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

### ⚙️ **Backend: C# .NET, Golang, Python**

- **Frameworks**: .NET Core, Go-Fiber, FastAPI, PyTorch, Transformers, XTTS
- **Overview**: Combines C# .NET, Golang, and Python for a high-performance, scalable backend.

### 🗄️ **Database: Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)**

- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale applications with complex transactions.
- **Performance**: Optimized with advanced query processing and in-memory capabilities.
- **Security**: Robust features like encryption, threat detection, and compliance.
- **Integration**: Seamless with other Microsoft tools and services.

### 🔗 **Communication Protocols**

- **WebRTC**: Low-latency real-time communication for audio and video calls.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Reliable data transmission via RESTful APIs.

## 🤖 **AI Assistant**

The AI Assistant is a cornerstone of the platform, enabling intelligent and seamless interaction between users and the healthcare call center.

### 🌟 **Key Features**

- **🗣️ Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts speech into text using advanced recognition models.
- **💬 Large Language Model (LLM)**: Processes text to generate intelligent, context-aware responses tailored for healthcare interactions.
- **🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Transforms responses back into speech with a human-like voice output.

### ⚡ **Performance and Latency**

- **Ultra-Low Latency**: End-to-end latency from STT to LLM processing and TTS generation is under **`500 ms`**, ensuring near real-time interactions.

### 🧠 **Technological Advantages**

- **Accuracy**: Combines high-quality `STT` and `TTS` with LLM for precise responses.
- **Scalability**: Handles over **3000+ concurrent meetings on a single server**.
- **Security and Compliance**: Adheres to healthcare standards, ensuring data privacy.
